Prompt Templates for Llama-2 Text Processing.

This module defines the system prompts and response formats used to instruct the Llama-2
model in various text processing tasks. Each template is designed for a specific style
of text processing while maintaining strict rules about word preservation and formatting.

Templates:
    - default: Standard text processing with general formatting
    - academic: Academic-style formatting with scholarly analysis
    - technical: Technical documentation style formatting
    - business: Business-style formatting

Each template includes:
    - system_prompt: Detailed instructions for the model
    - response_format: Expected structure of the response

The templates ensure that:
    1. All original words are preserved
    2. Text is properly formatted
    3. Metadata (summary, tags, key points) is extracted
    4. Response is in a consistent JSON format

Example:
    ```python
    from prompt_templates import TEMPLATES
    
    # Get the default template
    template = TEMPLATES['default']
    
    # Access the system prompt
    system_prompt = template['system_prompt']
    ```
